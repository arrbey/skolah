## 🎯 What is this?

AI agents are only as good as the instructions they follow. **AI Agent Skills** is a curated, battle-tested library of skill files — structured markdown prompts — that transform AI coding agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) into disciplined, production-ready engineers.

Unlike generic prompts, these skills encode **actual workflows** with steps, checkpoints, verification gates, and anti-pattern guards — the same discipline senior engineers bring to every production deployment.

```

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Step 1 — Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DevelopersGlobal/ai-agent-skills.git
```

### Step 2 — Pick a skill and copy it into your agent

**Claude / Cursor / Copilot / any agent:**
Copy the contents of any `SKILL.md` file into your agent's system prompt, instructions file, or context window.

**For Claude Code** — add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:
```bash
cat skills/think-before-coding/SKILL.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

**For Cursor** — copy into `.cursor/rules/`:
```bash
cp skills/security-hardening/SKILL.md .cursor/rules/security-hardening.mdc
```

**For Gemini CLI** — add to your project's `GEMINI.md`:
```bash
cat skills/goal-driven-execution/SKILL.md >> GEMINI.md
```

**One-liner (any skill, any agent):**
```bash
# View raw skill content, then paste into your agent
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevelopersGlobal/ai-agent-skills/main/skills/production-deployment/SKILL.md
```
